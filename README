NAME
    libmicrotocsv.pl - Run on libMicro output to convert to csv (printed to
    STDOUT).

SYNOPSIS
    libmicrotocsv.pl file...

          -h --help                  Print this help documentation
          --data [name1[,name2...]]  Read and order data as specified

DESCRIPTION
    This script parses libMicro output. It would be a lot simpler if it just
    needed to do some regex ninja action, but instead libMicro seems to have
    very different output depending on the options you give it.

    *INSTEAD* this script does a lookahead to see if the file is as it
    expects, then adjusts its parsing accordingly. This isn't garunteed to
    handle all sitations, please report issues you see to me!

  DATA SPECS
    This program also includes the option of specifying the data to read and
    in what order it should be printed (Name of the benchmark will always be
    the first entry in a row).
